# üìò What is buildspec.yml?

The `buildspec.yml` is a YAML file that defines the build commands and settings used by AWS CodeBuild. It tells CodeBuild what to do at each phase of the build lifecycle ‚Äî such as installing dependencies, compiling code, running tests, and packaging artifacts.

- Must be named `buildspec.yml` by default (can be overridden in the CodeBuild project settings).
- Must be placed in the root directory of your source code repository (or a specified path).

# üìÑ Basic Structure of buildspec.yml

\`\`\`yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - echo Installing dependencies
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Building the application
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`

artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'

# üß© File Sections Explained

## 1. version
- Defines the buildspec version.
- Supported: `0.1` (legacy), `0.2` (recommended).

## 2. env (Environment Variables)

Define variables used during the build.

\`\`\`yaml
env:
  variables:
    NODE_ENV: production
  parameter-store:
    DB_PASSWORD: /my/db/password
  secrets-manager:
    API_KEY: mySecret:api_key
\`\`\`

- Plaintext: under `variables`
- Secure values: from Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager

## 3. phases

Specifies commands in the build lifecycle:

| Phase       | Purpose                                   |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| install     | Set up tools and runtime environments     |
| pre_build   | Authentication, environment prep, linting |
| build       | Compilation, bundling, test execution     |
| post_build  | Cleanup, report generation, notifications |

Each phase can include:
- `commands`: A list of shell commands.
- `runtime-versions`: Language versions (e.g., Node.js, Python).

### Example with runtime version:
\`\`\`yaml
install:
  runtime-versions:
    nodejs: 18
  commands:
    - npm install
\`\`\`

## 4. artifacts

Specifies which files to archive after build.

\`\`\`yaml
artifacts:
  files:
    - 'dist/**/*'
  base-directory: 'dist'
  name: 'my-artifact.zip'
  discard-paths: yes
\`\`\`

- `files`: Wildcard patterns allowed.
- `base-directory`: Optional, changes root for artifacts.
- `discard-paths`: If true, files are flattened.

## 5. reports

Used for test results (e.g., JUnit, Cucumber).

\`\`\`yaml
reports:
  my-report:
    files:
      - '**/test-results.xml'
    file-format: JUNITXML
    base-directory: reports/
\`\`\`

## 6. cache

Used to speed up builds by caching dependencies.

\`\`\`yaml
cache:
  paths:
    - 'node_modules/**/*'
    - '/root/.cache/pip'
\`\`\`

- Automatically stored in S3 between builds.

## 7. timeout-in-minutes

Sets maximum build time (default: 60 minutes).

\`\`\`yaml
timeout-in-minutes: 30
\`\`\`

## 8. logs

Optional logging config (usually defined in the project itself).

\`\`\`yaml
logs:
  cloudwatch:
    enabled: true
    group_name: my-log-group
    stream_name: build-log
\`\`\`

# ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use `runtime-versions` for consistent environments.
- Always include a `post_build` section for reporting or cleanup.
- Enable caching for dependency-heavy builds.
- Use environment variables to manage secrets securely.
- Test your `buildspec.yml` locally with a Docker container or using CodeBuild's local agent.
- Separate build and deploy responsibilities clearly.

\`\`\`yaml
version: 0.2

phases:

    commands:
      - echo Building the app...
      - npm run build
  post_build:
    commands:

# üß™ Sample with Test Reports

\`\`\`yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - npm install
      - npm test -- --reporters=junit
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
reports:
  unit-test-results:
    files:
      - 'test-results.xml'
    file-format: JUNITXML

# üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips

- **File not found?** Make sure `buildspec.yml` is at the repo root or set explicitly in the project config.
- **Secrets not working?** Verify permissions for Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.
- **Build fails with exit code 255?** Usually indicates permission or syntax errors.
- **Artifacts empty?** Confirm correct base-directory and file patterns.
