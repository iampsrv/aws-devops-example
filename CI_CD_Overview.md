# üìò What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: The practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository and verifying them with automated builds and tests.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: The practice of automatically preparing code for deployment to staging or production environments.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** (optional extension): The practice of automatically deploying every change that passes all stages of your pipeline directly to production.

# üéØ Goals of CI/CD

- Faster and safer software delivery  
- Higher code quality and reliability  
- Automated testing and deployment  
- Early detection of bugs  
- Improved developer productivity

# üîÅ CI/CD Pipeline Lifecycle

## 1. Source Stage
- Detects changes in version control (e.g., GitHub, CodeCommit)
- Triggers the CI/CD pipeline

## 2. Build Stage
- Compiles source code
- Installs dependencies
- Produces artifacts

## 3. Test Stage
- Runs automated tests:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - UI/End-to-end tests

## 4. Package/Artifact Stage
- Bundles the application into deployable packages (e.g., Docker image, JAR)

## 5. Deploy Stage
- Pushes the code to staging or production
- May involve approval steps or full automation

## 6. Monitor Stage
- Observes performance, logs, and metrics post-deployment

# üß© Components of CI/CD

| Component         | Role                                       |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Source Control    | Manages code versions (Git, GitHub, GitLab)|
| CI Server         | Automates builds/tests (Jenkins, GitLab CI)|
| Artifact Repository | Stores build output (Nexus, Artifactory) |
| Deployment Tool   | Automates release (CodeDeploy, Spinnaker)  |

# ‚úÖ Best Practices for CI/CD

## ‚úÖ Continuous Integration
- Commit small, frequent changes  
- Run fast, reliable tests  
- Use feature branches and pull requests  
- Automate linting, testing, and merging  

## ‚úÖ Continuous Delivery
- Use staging environments to mirror production  
- Automate approvals and rollback processes  
- Generate and store build artifacts consistently  

## ‚úÖ Continuous Deployment
- Monitor health after each release  
- Use blue/green or canary deployments  
- Log everything for observability and debugging

# üß† Benefits of CI/CD

- Faster release cycles  
- Reduced manual effort  
- Improved collaboration  
- Better product quality  
- Lower mean time to recover (MTTR)

# üîê CI/CD and DevSecOps

DevSecOps integrates security into CI/CD pipelines:

- Static analysis (SAST)  
- Dependency scanning  
- Container vulnerability scans  

**Tools**: SonarQube, Snyk, Aqua Security, Checkmarx

# üöÄ CI/CD Example with AWS

Pipeline:
- **CodeCommit** ‚Äì source repo  
- **CodeBuild** ‚Äì compile and test code  
- **CodeDeploy** ‚Äì deploy to EC2, ECS, or Lambda  
- **CloudWatch** ‚Äì monitor and alert
