# 📘 Overview of AWS CodeCommit

AWS CodeCommit is a fully managed source control service that hosts Git repositories. It’s designed to make it easier for teams to store and manage code, binaries, and other digital assets in the cloud.

## 🚀 Built on Git
- Fully compatible with Git command-line tools and clients.

## 🔒 Secure
- Data is encrypted at rest and in transit using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

## 📈 Scalable
- Can handle any number of repositories, users, and files.

## 🔗 Integrated with AWS ecosystem
- Works seamlessly with other AWS services like CodePipeline, CodeBuild, IAM, CloudWatch, etc.

# 🔧 Key Features

## 1. Repository Management
- Create, clone, and manage multiple Git repositories.
- Supports Git features like branches, tags, commits, and merges.
- Web console for code browsing, reviewing, and diffing.

## 2. Access Control
- **IAM policies**: Fine-grained permissions for users and roles.
- **SSH keys / HTTPS credentials**: Used for authentication.
- Supports AWS Secrets Manager and IAM federation.

## 3. Security

# 🛠️ Integration with Other AWS Services

## 1. AWS CodePipeline
- Use CodeCommit as a source stage in CI/CD pipelines.
- Automatically triggers builds and deployments.

## 2. AWS CodeBuild
- Fetches code from CodeCommit to run builds/tests.
- Compatible with webhooks and CodePipeline.

## 3. AWS Lambda
- Trigger Lambda functions on repository events.
- Useful for custom actions (e.g., sending Slack alerts, enforcing policies).

## 4. CloudWatch
- Monitor repository events and performance.
- Send alerts and dashboards.

# 👨‍💻 Common Use Cases
- Hosting Git repositories securely in AWS.
- Source code collaboration across globally distributed teams.
- Automating deployments with CodePipeline + CodeCommit.
- Implementing GitOps workflows.
- Integrating compliance/audit pipelines using triggers.

# 📝 Working with CodeCommit

## 1. Setup
- Create a repo using AWS Console, CLI, or SDK.
- Configure local Git client:
  - HTTPS (credential helper or Git credentials)
  - SSH (upload SSH public key to IAM user)

## 2. Cloning and Pushing
```bash
git clone https://git-codecommit.<region>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name>
cd <repo-name>
# Add files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

## 3. Pull Requests
- Create pull requests in the AWS Console.
- Review, comment, and merge PRs.
- Integrate approval rules.

# 📊 Pricing

- No charge for CodeCommit repositories.
- Charges apply only for storage and Git requests:
  - First 5 active users: Free tier.
  - After that: ~$1/user/month (subject to change).
- Standard AWS data transfer fees apply.

---

# ✅ Best Practices

- Use IAM roles/policies to tightly control access.
- Set up approval rules for pull requests.
- Automate deployments using CodePipeline.
- Monitor commits and repo activity with CloudWatch.
- Regularly audit access and review CloudTrail logs.

# 🧠 Pros and Cons

## ✅ Pros:
- Fully managed and serverless.
- Tight AWS integration.
- Secure, scalable, and easy to use for AWS teams.
- No limit on repository size or file types.

## ❌ Cons:
- Less feature-rich than GitHub/GitLab for community and UI.
- Lacks extensive 3rd-party integrations.
- UI is functional but minimalistic.
