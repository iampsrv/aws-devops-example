# üìò Overview of AWS CodePipeline

AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that automates the building, testing, and deploying of code every time there is a code change.

- Automated release pipelines improve delivery speed and consistency.
- Integrates with AWS services (e.g., CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy).
- Supports third-party tools like GitHub, Jenkins, and others.
- Pay-as-you-go pricing.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components

## 1. Pipeline
- A sequence of stages and actions that define the software release process.
- Automatically triggered by a change in source code (or manual trigger).

## 2. Stage
- Logical grouping of actions (e.g., Source, Build, Test, Deploy).
- Each stage can have one or more actions running in parallel or sequentially.

## 3. Action
A task performed in a stage:
- **Source** (fetch code from GitHub, CodeCommit)
- **Build** (run with CodeBuild, Jenkins)
- **Test**
- **Deploy** (with CodeDeploy, ECS, Lambda)
- **Approval** (manual or automated gate)

# üîó Integration with AWS and Third-Party Services

| Category     | Services                                |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Source       | CodeCommit, GitHub, Bitbucket, S3       |
| Build/Test   | CodeBuild, Jenkins, TeamCity            |
| Deploy       | CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, ECS, Lambda |
| Notifications| SNS, CloudWatch Events                  |
| Approval     | Manual approval actions                 |

---

# üõ†Ô∏è Example Pipeline Flow

1. **Source Stage**: Triggered on code commit in CodeCommit/GitHub.
2. **Build Stage**: CodeBuild compiles and tests the code.
3. **Test Stage**: Optional, runs additional integration tests.
4. **Approval Stage**: Manual checkpoint before deployment (optional).
5. **Deploy Stage**: Deploys to EC2, Lambda, or ECS.

# üß© Supported Action Types

| Type     | Description                        |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| Source   | Fetches code from repo/S3          |
| Build    | Compiles code, runs tests          |
| Test     | Executes testing scripts           |
| Deploy   | Deploys artifacts                  |
| Approval | Manual confirmation before proceeding |
| Invoke   | Triggers Lambda functions          |

# üìÇ Artifact Management

- Each action may produce or consume artifacts (ZIP, directories, binaries).
- Stored temporarily in Amazon S3 by CodePipeline.
- Artifacts are passed between stages as input/output.

---

# üîê Security and Access Control

- Uses IAM roles and policies for:
  - Pipeline execution
  - Service integration (CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, etc.)
- Supports encryption of artifacts in S3 using AWS KMS.
- Least privilege is best practice for service roles.

---

# üìÑ Pipeline Configuration Options

- YAML or JSON definition for pipeline structure (for IaC tools like CloudFormation, CDK).
- AWS Console, CLI, SDKs also supported for pipeline creation and management.

---

# ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Keep stages atomic: one function per stage/action.
- Use manual approvals for production deployments.
- Integrate CloudWatch Alarms to monitor performance.
- Enable notifications using SNS or EventBridge.
- Version your buildspec and appspec files for rollback and audit.
- Secure your pipeline IAM roles and restrict access.
- Use feature branches and PRs with separate pipelines if needed.

---

# üîÑ Change Detection and Triggers

- **Automatic trigger**: When a source code repository is updated.
- **Manual trigger**: Through console, CLI, or SDK.
- **Schedule-based**: Via EventBridge for periodic builds.

---

# üîî Monitoring and Notifications

## AWS CloudWatch
- Logs pipeline activities.
- Can trigger alarms for failures or delays.

## Amazon SNS
- Send email, SMS, or invoke Lambda on pipeline events.

---

# üíµ Pricing

- $1 per active pipeline per month.
- Charges apply for underlying services (CodeBuild, Lambda, EC2, etc.).
- First pipeline per month per account is free (with limited usage).
- Refer to: [CodePipeline Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/pricing/)

---

# üß† Typical Use Cases

- Automating build, test, and deployment of:
  - Microservices
  - Lambda functions
  - Containerized apps on ECS/EKS
  - Traditional applications on EC2
- Supporting multiple environments (Dev, Staging, Prod)
- Managing blue/green and canary deployments

---

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- No built-in support for branching strategies (use Git hooks or CodeBuild logic).
- Pipeline UI is functional but limited in customization.
- Default artifact storage is limited to S3 (no external storage).
- Limited support for complex fan-in/fan-out workflows.
